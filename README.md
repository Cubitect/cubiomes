# cubiomes

Cubiomes is a standalone library, written in C, that mimics the biome and feature generation of Minecraft Java Edition.
It is intended as a powerful tool to devise very fast, custom seed finding applications and large-scale map viewers with minimal memory usage.


#### Cubiomes-Viewer

If you want to get started without coding, there is now also a [graphical application](https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes-viewer) based on this library.


#### Audience

You should be familiar with the C programming language. A basic understanding of the Minecraft biome generation process would also be helpful.


## Getting Started

This section is meant to give you a quick starting point with small example programs if you want to use this library to find your own biome dependent features.

### Generate an image of the world (using cubiomes_utils.c)

This script will generate an image called `map_[seed].ppm` in the directory it was ran in.

```C
    //Set version and seed
    int mc = MC_1_19;
    uint64_t seed = 686689767;

    //Apply seed and dimension
    Generator g;
    setupGenerator(&g, mc, 0);
    applySeed(&g, DIM_OVERWORLD, seed);

    //Center point to generate from, this example being X: 0, Z: 0 in the overworld. 
    int x = 0, z = 0;

    //The size of the map. Will generate from the center of the x/z coordinates.
    int mapWidth = 120*8, mapHeight = 120*8; //960x960

    //How many pixels per biome block. This example generates a 960x960 image. 
    //If the pixelScale was 4, it would be 3840x3840.
    int pixelScale = 1;

    //Scale of the map, 1 being the smallest.
    int scale = 1;

    //Height (Y) of the biome generation.
    int height = 100;

    //Generates a .ppm file with the given params. (map_[seed].ppm)
    createMap(g, mapWidth, mapHeight, scale, height, x, z, pixelScale);
```

### Search for structures in range (using cubiomes_utils.c)

This script will return a list of structures within a given range of the X and Z coordinates.

```C
    //Set version and seed
    int mc = MC_1_19;
    uint64_t seed = 686689767;

    //Apply seed and dimension
    Generator g;
    setupGenerator(&g, mc, 0);
    applySeed(&g, DIM_OVERWORLD, seed);

    //Center point to search from, this example being X: 0, Z: 0 in the overworld. 
    int x = 0, z = 0;

    //Search range. This example will search in a 2000 block range around the given X/Z coordinates.
    int range = 2000;

    //Structure to search for.
    int structureType = Village;
    
    //This method returns a string containing the X/Z coordinates, and the distance in blocks it is 
    //from the given X/Z coordinates.
    char *result =  findStructures(structureType, g, range, x, z);

    //Iterate through the structures that were found
    char *token = strtok(result, "\n");
    if(token ==  NULL) 
    {   //Either no structures were found, or there was a config error
        printf("Error: %s", result);
    }

    while (token != NULL)
    {   //Prints out the coordinate data and distance
        printf("%s (X,Z,Distance): %s\n", struct2str(structureType), token);
        token = strtok(NULL, "\n");
    }
```

### Search for strongholds (using cubiomes_utils.c)

This script will return the position of stronghold.

```C
    //Set version and seed
    int mc = MC_1_19;
    uint64_t seed = 686689767;

    //Apply seed and dimension
    Generator g;
    setupGenerator(&g, mc, 0);
    applySeed(&g, DIM_OVERWORLD, seed);

    //Center point to search from, this example being X: 0, Z: 0. 
    int x = 0, z = 0;

    //The amount of strongholds you want to search for.
    int limit = 5;

    //This method returns a string containing the X/Z coordinates, and the distance in blocks it is 
    //from the given X/Z coordinates.
    char *result = findStrongholds(g, x, z, limit);

    //Iterate through the strongholds
    char *token = strtok(result, "\n");

    if(token ==  NULL) 
    {   //Either no strongholds were found, or there was a config error
        printf("Error: %s", result);
    }

    while (token != NULL)
    {   //Prints out the coordinate data and distance
        printf("Stronghold (X,Z,Distance): %s\n", token);
        token = strtok(NULL, "\n");
    }
```

### Biome Generator

```C
// check the biome at a block position
#include "generator.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    // Set up a biome generator that reflects the biome generation of
    // Minecraft 1.18.
    Generator g;
    setupGenerator(&g, MC_1_18, 0);

    // Seeds are internally represented as unsigned 64-bit integers.
    uint64_t seed;
    for (seed = 0; ; seed++)
    {
        // Apply the seed to the generator for the Overworld dimension.
        applySeed(&g, DIM_OVERWORLD, seed);

        // To get the biome at a single block position, we can use getBiomeAt().
        int scale = 1; // scale=1: block coordinates, scale=4: biome coordinates
        int x = 0, y = 63, z = 0;
        int biomeID = getBiomeAt(&g, scale, x, y, z);
        if (biomeID == mushroom_fields)
        {
            printf("Seed %" PRId64 " has a Mushroom Fields biome at "
                "block position (%d, %d).\n", (int64_t) seed, x, z);
            break;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

You can compile this code either by directly adding a target to the makefile via
```
$ cd cubiomes
$ make libcubiomes
```
...or you can compile and link to a cubiomes archive using either of the following commands.
```
$ gcc find_biome_at.c libcubiomes.a -fwrapv -lm   # static
$ gcc find_biome_at.c -L. -lcubiomes -fwrapv -lm  # dynamic
```
Both commands assume that your source code is saved as `find_biome_at.c` in the cubiomes working directory. If your makefile is configured to use pthreads, you may also need to add the `-lpthread` option to the compiler.
The option `-fwrapv` enforces two's complement for signed integer overflow, which this library relies on. It is not strictly necessary for this example as the library should already be compiled with this flag, but it is good practice to prevent undefined behaviour.
Running the program should output:
```
$ ./a.out
Seed 262 has a Mushroom Fields biome at block position (0, 0).
```

### Biome Generation in a Range

We can also generate biomes for an area or volume using `genBiomes()`. This will utilize whatever optimizations are available for the generator and can be much faster than generating each position individually. (The layered generators for versions up to 1.17 will benefit significantly more from this than the noise-based ones.)

Before we can generate the biomes for an area or volume, we need to define the bounds with a `Range` structure and allocate the necessary buffer using `allocCache()`. The `Range` is described by a scale, position, and size, where each cell inside the `Range` represents `scale` many blocks in the horizontal axes. The vertical direction is treated separately and always follows the biome coordinate scaling of 1:4, with the exception of when `scale == 1`, in which case the vertical scaling is also 1:1.

The only supported values for `scale` are 1, 4, 16, 64, and (for the Overworld) 256. For versions up to 1.17, the scale is matched to an appropriate biome layer and will influence the biomes that can generate.

```C
// generate an image of the world
#include "generator.h"
#include "util.h"

int main()
{
    Generator g;
    setupGenerator(&g, MC_1_18, LARGE_BIOMES);

    uint64_t seed = 123LL;
    applySeed(&g, DIM_OVERWORLD, seed);

    Range r;
    // 1:16, a.k.a. horizontal chunk scaling
    r.scale = 16;
    // Define the position and size for a horizontal area:
    r.x = -60, r.z = -60;   // position (x,z)
    r.sx = 120, r.sz = 120; // size (width,height)
    // Set the vertical range as a plane near sea level at scale 1:4.
    r.y = 15, r.sy = 1;

    // Allocate the necessary cache for this range.
    int *biomeIds = allocCache(&g, r);

    // Generate the area inside biomeIds, indexed as:
    // biomeIds[i_y*r.sx*r.sz + i_z*r.sx + i_x]
    // where (i_x, i_y, i_z) is a position relative to the range cuboid.
    genBiomes(&g, biomeIds, r);

    // Map the biomes to an image buffer, with 4 pixels per biome cell.
    int pix4cell = 4;
    int imgWidth = pix4cell*r.sx, imgHeight = pix4cell*r.sz;
    unsigned char biomeColors[256][3];
    initBiomeColors(biomeColors);
    unsigned char *rgb = (unsigned char *) malloc(3*imgWidth*imgHeight);
    biomesToImage(rgb, biomeColors, biomeIds, r.sx, r.sz, pix4cell, 2);

    // Save the RGB buffer to a PPM image file.
    savePPM("map.ppm", rgb, imgWidth, imgHeight);

    // Clean up.
    free(biomeIds);
    free(rgb);

    return 0;
}
```


### Structure Generation

The generation of structures can usually be regarded as a two-stage process: generation attempts and biome checks. For most structures, Minecraft divides the world into a grid of regions (usually 32x32 chunks) and performs one generation attempt in each. We can use `getStructurePos()` to get the position of such a generation attempt, and then test whether a structure will actually generate there with `isViableStructurePos()`; however, this is more expensive to compute (requiring many microseconds instead of nanoseconds).

Note: some structures (in particular desert pyramids, jungle temples and woodland mansions) in 1.18 no longer depend solely on the biomes and can also fail to generate based on the surface height near the generation attempt. Unfortunately, cubiomes does not provide block level world generation and cannot check for this, and may therefore yield false positive positions. Support for an approximation for the surface height might be added in the future to improve accuracy.


```C
// find a seed with a certain structure at the origin chunk
#include "finders.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int structType = Outpost;
    int mc = MC_1_18;

    Generator g;
    setupGenerator(&g, mc, 0);

    uint64_t lower48;
    for (lower48 = 0; ; lower48++)
    {
        // The structure position depends only on the region coordinates and
        // the lower 48-bits of the world seed.
        Pos p;
        if (!getStructurePos(structType, mc, lower48, 0, 0, &p))
            continue;

        // Look for a seed with the structure at the origin chunk.
        if (p.x >= 16 || p.z >= 16)
            continue;

        // Look for a full 64-bit seed with viable biomes.
        uint64_t upper16;
        for (upper16 = 0; upper16 < 0x10000; upper16++)
        {
            uint64_t seed = lower48 | (upper16 << 48);
            applySeed(&g, DIM_OVERWORLD, seed);
            if (isViableStructurePos(structType, &g, p.x, p.z, 0))
            {
                printf("Seed %" PRId64 " has a Pillager Outpost at (%d, %d).\n",
                    (int64_t) seed, p.x, p.z);
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Quad-Witch-Huts

A commonly desired feature are Quad-Witch-Huts or similar multi-structure clusters. To test for these types of seeds, we can look a little deeper into how the generation attempts are determined. Notice that the positions depend only on the structure type, region coordinates and the lower 48 bits of the seed. Also, once we have found a seed with the desired generation attemps, we can move them around by transforming the 48-bit seed using `moveStructure()`. This means there is a set of seed bases which can function as a starting point to generate all other seeds with similar structure placement.

The function `searchAll48()` can be used to find a complete set of 48-bit seed bases for a custom criterion. Given that in general it can take a very long time to check all 2^48 seeds (days or weeks), the function provides some functionality to save the results to disk which can be loaded again using `loadSavedSeeds()`. Luckily, it is possible in some cases to reduce the search space even further: for Swamp Huts and structures with a similar structure configuration, there are only a handful of constellations where the structures are close enough together to run simultaneously. Conveniently, these constellations differ uniquely at the lower 20 bits. (This is hard to prove, or at least I haven't found a rigorous proof that doesn't rely on brute forcing.) By specifying a list of lower 20-bit values, we can reduce the search space to the order of 2^28, which can be checked in a reasonable amount of time.


```C
// find seeds with a quad-witch-hut about the origin
#include "quadbase.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int check(uint64_t s48, void *data)
{
    const StructureConfig sconf = *(const StructureConfig*) data;
    return isQuadBase(sconf, s48 - sconf.salt, 128);
}

int main()
{
    int styp = Swamp_Hut;
    int mc = MC_1_18;
    uint64_t basecnt = 0;
    uint64_t *bases = NULL;
    int threads = 8;
    Generator g;

    StructureConfig sconf;
    getStructureConfig(styp, mc, &sconf);

    printf("Preparing seed bases...\n");
    // Get all 48-bit quad-witch-hut bases, but consider only the best 20-bit
    // constellations where the structures are the closest together.
    int err = searchAll48(
        &bases, &basecnt, NULL, threads,
        low20QuadIdeal, sizeof(low20QuadIdeal) / sizeof(uint64_t), 20,
        check, &sconf
        );

    if (err || !bases)
    {
        printf("Failed to generate seed bases.\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    setupGenerator(&g, mc, 0);

    uint64_t i;
    for (i = 0; i < basecnt; i++)
    {
        // The quad bases by themselves have structures in regions (0,0)-(1,1)
        // so we can move them by -1 regions to have them around the origin.
        uint64_t s48 = moveStructure(bases[i] - sconf.salt, -1, -1);

        Pos pos[4];
        getStructurePos(styp, mc, s48, -1, -1, &pos[0]);
        getStructurePos(styp, mc, s48, -1,  0, &pos[1]);
        getStructurePos(styp, mc, s48,  0, -1, &pos[2]);
        getStructurePos(styp, mc, s48,  0,  0, &pos[3]);

        uint64_t high;
        for (high = 0; high < 0x10000; high++)
        {
            uint64_t seed = s48 | (high << 48);
            applySeed(&g, DIM_OVERWORLD, seed);

            if (isViableStructurePos(styp, &g, pos[0].x, pos[0].z, 0) &&
                isViableStructurePos(styp, &g, pos[1].x, pos[1].z, 0) &&
                isViableStructurePos(styp, &g, pos[2].x, pos[2].z, 0) &&
                isViableStructurePos(styp, &g, pos[3].x, pos[3].z, 0))
            {
                printf("%" PRId64 "\n", (int64_t) seed);
            }
        }
    }

    free(bases);
    return 0;
}
```

#### Strongholds and Spawn

Strongholds, as well as the world spawn point, actually search until they find a suitable location, rather than checking a single spot like most other structures. This causes them to be particularly performance expensive to find. Furthermore, the positions of strongholds have to be generated in a certain order, which can be done in an iterative fashion with `initFirstStronghold()` and `nextStronghold()`. For the world spawn, the generation starts with a search for a suitable biome near the origin, and will continue until a grass or podzol block is found. There is no reliable way to check actual blocks, so the search relies on a statistic, matching grass presence to biomes. Alternatively, we can simply use `estimateSpawn()` and terminate the search after the first biome check under the assumption that grass is nearby.


```C
// find spawn and the first N strongholds
#include "finders.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int mc = MC_1_18;
    uint64_t seed = 3055141959546LL;

    // Only the first stronghold has a position which can be estimated
    // (+/-112 blocks) without biome check.
    StrongholdIter sh;
    Pos pos = initFirstStronghold(&sh, mc, seed);

    printf("Seed: %" PRId64 "\n", (int64_t) seed);
    printf("Estimated position of first stronghold: (%d, %d)\n", pos.x, pos.z);

    Generator g;
    setupGenerator(&g, mc, 0);
    applySeed(&g, DIM_OVERWORLD, seed);

    pos = getSpawn(&g);
    printf("Spawn: (%d, %d)\n", pos.x, pos.z);

    int i, N = 12;
    for (i = 1; i <= N; i++)
    {
        if (nextStronghold(&sh, &g) <= 0)
            break;
        printf("Stronghold #%-3d: (%6d, %6d)\n", i, sh.pos.x, sh.pos.z);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
